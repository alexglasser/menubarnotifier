This is a simple script to display a message in the Mac OS X menubar using 
PyObjC. Make sure you have PyObjC installed - you can do this using MacPorts 
or Homebrew.

Call the script with the desired notification as the first and only argument:
  ./menubarnotifier "Notification Text"

Feel free to use this code for whatever you want.
